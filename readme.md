MultiMon
==========================================
MultiMon is a Linux server adminitration panel for dotNet.<br>
It comes with the following features:<br>
-SSH<br>
-SCP<br>
-Macros<br>
-Syslog viewer<br>
-Server Monitoring<br>
-Notes<br>
<br>
Everything is put together on one screen. You won't have to login seperately to your ssh 
and your scp or run cmd commands or switch tabs to reach the file upload. Simply double-click on a SSH session and everything will
connect and update automatically.<br>
Add macros and servermonitoring on demand.<br>
<br><br>
Caveat: The terminal is not stream based, thus stuff like vi or pipes won't work.
